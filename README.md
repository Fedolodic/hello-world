Hello everybody!

My name is Joenteny Martinez and I'm a software enginnering student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I like to workout, hang out with friends and listen to music. Currently I am writing this as part of an assignment for my programming in C/C++ in a UNIX environment course with Professor Richard Min.

Have a great day!
